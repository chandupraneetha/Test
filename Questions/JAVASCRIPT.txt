HTML(HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE):html is a scripting languauge(every scripting language has one open tag and closing tag) this HTML is a parent tag(main tag)

-> What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

TAGS:
----
[The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph
]

->What is an HTML Element?
A)An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

->Web Browsers
The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.

A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document

[Note: The content inside the <body> section will be displayed in a browser. The content inside the <title> element will be shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab]
-.whenever we run our HTMl file ,a parent or super document object model(DOM) will be created,inside that all our elements will be created
->Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.(the node js is used to run javascript code)
*every browser contain java script engine which executes our javascript code.
[HTML IS STATIC,THAT MEANS ONCE WE HAVE WRITTEN ANYTHING BETWEEN THE SCRIPTS IT CANNOT BE CHANGED]
[WE CAN CHANGE THE STYLES DYNAMICALLY(may be by user clicks or someother thing),CHANGE THE EXISTING CONTENT BY USING THE JAVASCRIPT]
->javascript can either run in the browser or in the Node.js which is a javaruntime environment 

->HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

[All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
(EG:<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>)
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
(EG:<img src="img_girl.jpg">)
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
(EG:<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">)
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
(EG:<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">)
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
(EG:<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>)
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
(
So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:
EG:<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
)
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element
The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:
(EG:<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>)
]

->HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
NOTE:With HTML, you cannot change the display by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
*The browser will automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed

->HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
*The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
[EG:<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>
]

->HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
*Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
[EG:<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>]

->The HTML <pre> Element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.
*The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
[EG:<pre>HELLO JAVA
         HELLO SPRINGBOOT
         HELLO JAVASCRIPT
    </pre>     ]

What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

-->A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

*CSS Syntax:
-------------
eg:h1{color:green;
   font-size:100%;}

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
